# Survival dev-team contributing guides


**Thank you for your time and effort**! Your work will make a difference in the lives of a lot of tribes around the world!

This repository contains general guides that apply to all our repos.

They are oriented towards beginners wanting to submit their first PR ([24PR](https://24pullrequests.com), [codebar](https://www.codebar.io/), etc.), external volunteers, and new staff.

If you are a beginner searching for your first pull request, search for issues with the label `good-first-issue`.

If you are a more experienced developer, look for issues with the label `volunteers`.

Our public open-source projects can be found at <https://github.com/survival>.
