# Survival dev-team contributing guides

This repository contains general guides that apply to all our repos.

They are oriented towards beginners wanting to submit their first PR ([24PR](https://24pullrequests.com), [codebar](https://www.codebar.io/), etc.), external volunteers, and new staff.


## Code of conduct

Most of our projects are Ruby projects, and we embrace the Ruby mantra "*Matz is nice and so we are nice*". Help us keep this project open and inclusive. Please read and follow our [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/survival/contributing-guides/code-of-conduct.md).
